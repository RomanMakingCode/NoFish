18-224/624 Spring 2023 Final Tapeout Project

## Overview
Cryptographic accelator for a symmetric-key block cipher. This algorithem is loosely based off of Blowfish; it uses substitution boxes and symmetric shifting much like Blowfish. This project was both an introduction to cryptography and tape outs. 

## How it Works


## Inputs/Outputs

(describe what each of the 12 input and 12 output pins are used for; )
2 bit input - mode select
4 bit input - hexidecimal output select
1 bit input - 0/1 for key/intxt entry
1 bit input - key ready, this tells selected SIPO register to shift in a bit

8 bits of output for 7 segment display 

## Hardware Peripherals

Dip switches to control input
7 Segment display output 

## Media
I hope to add results of tapeout chip,
